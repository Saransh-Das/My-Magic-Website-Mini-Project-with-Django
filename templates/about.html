                  <h2>Magic Is a Stress Healer</h2>

                  <p> Of course, Music isn’t the only form of art we rely on for emotional release. The Art Of Magic itself is another way of achieving it. Its roots began in 1886, when Swiss art historian Heinrich Wölfflin set out to link art with psychology, suggesting that art carries with it its moods and emotions. To illustrate this, he referenced architecture and the effect that its aesthetics have on us. Eventually, in the 20th century, art therapy as a profession was established. Today, it is gaining traction and rapidly becoming prevalent world over. Art expression and art therapy have been shown to have a variety of benefits such as improving empathy, mindfulness, and the release of emotions. </p>
